### Welcome Avizhe Group in Github!

We established our company in 2008. At first, we designed and programmed different software packages in several fields. Then gradually we focused on RFID solutions. Now we consult, design, and implement RFID solutions for our clients.
There are few professional RFID companies in Iran. Our company is a specialist. We know that every project is different and needs its own proposal. So we communicate with our clients to understand their processes in warehousing, production lines, distribution systems, retailing system, and other things relating to logistics. We may sometimes need reengineering in processes.
After consulting our clients, if RFID be suitable for them, we start designing their RFID system. When we agree on a design with them then we implement and finally give them supportive services.
